    comment:"I prefer a Fixed rate and most recommended me to take up the 2 years lock in package since it was the lowest. However Luck Sin take one step further to find out that i have the intention to sell my property and was quick to point out that it might not be feasible for refinancing because of the subsidies clawback from the banks. Managed to dodge a bullet there and i highly recommend Delux to all homeowners looking to refinance. Thank you Luck Sin!"},
